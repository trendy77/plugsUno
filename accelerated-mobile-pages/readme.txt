**NOTE:** Next Update of this plugin will be released by end of Dec 2016.


**[JOIN CHAT GROUP COMMUNITY](http://ampforwp.com/community/)**: Purpose of this group is to get proper suggestions and feedback from plugin users and the community so that we can make the plugin even better.

**How to test if AMP is working or not?**
After you install the plugin, Google will automatically index the amp pages using the amp tag and then show you the updates in the search console.

**How can I view the AMP version of my site**
To view the AMP version, add /?amp at the end of your url. An example would be http://Website.com/?amp .... and No, you don't have to worry about duplication of the content because that has been taken care of the canonical tag as suggested by Google.

**How do I Report Bugs and Suggest New Features**
<i>You</i> can report the bugs at https://github.com/ahmedkaludi/Accelerated-Mobile-Pages/issues

**Will you Add New features upon my request?**

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You can access your amp enabled website by adding ?amp at the end of the url.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How to Setup Navigation Menu? =
We have created a Seperate Navigation menu for AMP version which you can setup from the WordPress Menus, then navigate to Menu Locations, their you will notice AMP Menu. You can assign existing menus to this locations.

= I added /?amp on the end of one of my URLs and a minimalist version of my page appeared. It looks just like on one of your screenshots, so I guess its installed properly. Okay what now? Is it just enough to install it and the plugin will do the rest? =

After you see the minimalist view if you use the url with ?amp then it means that it has been installed properly. You dont need any extra steps to enable it.

= The plugin supposed to redirect all mobile visitors to AMP version of site or not? =
When you view the website from the mobile, it is not supposed to redirect you to the amp version, amp version is always ready for google in the backend, if Google wants to serve to the people, then it will get the amp version and serve to the customers.

= I am worried that it will cause Duplicate content? =
In the AMP version, we are using Canonical tag to solve this. I am 100% sure that using this plugin will not duplicate the content.
